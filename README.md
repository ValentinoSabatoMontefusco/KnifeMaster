Mod attempt from the pre Baldur's Gate 3 official modding toolkit era. 

The aim of the mod was to develop a new Rogue subclass called KnifeMaster that would take the Assassin's main game design aspects and shuffle the power budget around to create an hopefully more engaging experience.

It was a formative experience with regard to scripting in Lua and Larian's game environment thanks to the excellent BG 3 modding community and Norbyte Script Extender. 

It's usable, albeit not complete.
